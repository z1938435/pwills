# About Me
I am a student at Northern Illinois University studying
Operations Management and Information Systems. 
I am graduating December of 2023 and I am currently seeking
employment opportunities post-grad.

Throughout my time at NIU I have learned many valuable skills
both inside and outside of the classroom. Inside the classroom 
I have worked on developing competencies in SQL, Python, Tableau,
PowerBI, SAP, and SAS. While outside the classroom, thanks to my internship
and opportunity in the NIU Experential Learning Center I have developed
strong professional communication and public speaking skills.

Data analytics is what initially brought me to my major, guided
by my love for sports statistics. Visualizing data using Tableau and writing 
complex queries in SQL have been my favorite areas of study thus far.
I hope to find employment as a data, business, or financial analyst
where I can use my skills to be a valuable asset for a company.

I currently live in Downers Grove, Illinois with my family and two lovely dogs.
I spend most of my time watching sports, and when there are none to watch
I am on [baseball-reference](baseball-reference.com) or [fangraphs](fangraphs.com) digging into data.
