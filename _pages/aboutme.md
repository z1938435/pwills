# About Me

width="50%" hspace="20" align="right">

I help organizations understand and leverage their quantitative
information. Call it what you will: data science, machine learning, or
statistics; the modern technological world lies at the intersection of
mathematics and computing, and that's where I like to play.

I've worked with [unicorn start-ups][5] and [large publicly traded corporations][6],
building models, establishing codebases, and providing mathematical expertise to
developers. My mother tongue is Python, but I also speak Scala and Java. I have
experience working with the full Python data stack, and also have experience writing
Spark jobs in Scala and Java.

I have a bachelors degree in Physics from Reed College, where I did
[my thesis][2] on measurement of quantum entanglement in optical systems. After
spending some time pursuing other interests,[^fnote2] I began working on my
Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics at University of Colorado. My dissertation covers a
range of topics in statistics, data analytics, and understanding noisy
systems. For more details on all that, check out [my portfolio](/portfolio/), or
take a look at [my resume][4].

I live at the [EcoVillage in Ithaca](https://ecovillageithaca.org/). Most recently, I
worked remotely as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at [Abnormal
Security](https://abnormalsecurity.com/).

[^fnote2]: After graduating from Reed, I spent some time living at
	[Great Vow Zen Monastery][3], where we followed a daily schedule of work and
	meditation.
